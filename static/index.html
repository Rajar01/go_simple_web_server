        I'm partial to air conditioning. Keep your mind limber. God created
        pudding, and then he rested. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are
        there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one
        day they will be.

        Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to
        happen. Makes me a … scientist. You all right, Dexter? I'm Dexter, and
        I'm not sure what I am.

        <li>Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</li>

          I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

      <h3>Hello, Dexter Morgan.</h3>
      <p>
        Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm thinking two
        circus clowns dancing. You? I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do
        for me. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again.
        It has to happen.
      </p>

          Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you
          are a client.
        </li>
        <li>I'm generally confused most of the time.</li>
        <li>I'm really more an apartment person.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm
        something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. Only
        you could make those words cute. Watching ice melt. This is fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm generally confused most of the time. He taught me a code. To
        survive. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate
        funerals. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm
        thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?
      </p>
      <p>
        You look…perfect. He taught me a code. To survive. I think he's got a
        crush on you, Dex! I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        Makes me a … scientist. Rorschach would say you have a hard time
        relating to others. This man is a knight in shining armor. I think he's
        got a crush on you, Dex!
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are
        a client. Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what
        I am. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor
        beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter.
        Boo.

        I'm really more an apartment person. I'm doing mental jumping jacks.
        Watching ice melt. This is fun. You all right, Dexter?

        I'm really more an apartment person. I love Halloween. The one time of
        year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Makes me a … scientist.
        You all right, Dexter? Hello, Dexter Morgan.

        Keep your mind limber. Tell him time is of the essence. Rorschach would
        say you have a hard time relating to others. Hello, Dexter Morgan.
        You're a killer. I catch killers. Like a sloth. I can do that.
      </p>

        look…perfect. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! God created pudding,
        and then he rested. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm
        not even sure what the picture should be.
